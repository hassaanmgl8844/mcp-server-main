Generate a video script about the ${topic} in JSON format, structured as an array of scenes. Each scene should have the following properties:

- scene_duration: Number (in seconds), determined based on the audio text length.
- scene_description: A clear and detailed description of events in the scene, including visuals and actions relevant to the script. Make sure the scenes flow well, creating a cohesive storyline.
- audio_text: A fitting narration or dialogue that corresponds to the scene’s action and theme. This should be relevant to the visual description and add depth to the scene.
- image_prompt: A description of visual elements needed for generating images or animations based on the scene, such as colors, characters, emotions, or environments.
- image_file_name: Automatically generate the filename for the scene’s image, e.g., "scene1_image.png".
- audio_file_name: Automatically generate the filename for the scene’s audio, e.g., "scene1_audio.mp3".

You are allowed to create the scenes based on your understanding of the topic, but ensure the script fits into a 1-minute video short (around 60 seconds in total). Each scene should have an appropriate duration based on the importance of the content.

Example response for a 1-minute video about "Naruto":

```json

    "image_prompt": " a victorious expression.........",
    "image_file_name": "scene1_image.png",
    "audio_file_name": "scene1_audio.mp3"
  },
  {
    "scene_duration": 22,
    "scene_description": "willpower shine through as ..........",
    "audio_text": "up, no matter what! .........",
    "image_prompt": " a victorious expression.........",
